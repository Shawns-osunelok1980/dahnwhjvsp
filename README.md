Dude, just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Dual and... I'm kinda all over the place with it? First off, let’s just talk about Karen Gillan. She’s like that autopilot 𝘕𝘦𝘵𝘧𝘭𝘪𝘹 vibe actor, you know what I mean? She’s kind of perfect for this role in a way that feels so casual. But seriously, the whole concept of facing your own clone and having to fight them? I’m like, wow, innovative much? It's like they borrowed a bit from every sci-fi flick and smushed it together, but somehow it works?

> Also, can we talk about that training montage scene? I mean, who knew prepping for a death match with YOURSELF could be low-key hilarious? I snorted more than once. And like, the deadpan humor was just... chef’s kiss. I swear, at one point I forgot it was a science fiction thing. Felt like a dark comedy, not gonna lie. But still, had to remind myself to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   because it’s worth a second go, just to catch what I missed.

Did you notice how everyone acted so chill about the whole “hey, we’ll just make another you and see who survives” situation? Like, totally casual. I was just sitting there, mouth open, thinking... is this what society is coming to? 😂 BRB while I go clone myself to take next week’s meetings for me. Jk but kinda not? Man, I don’t even know anymore. 😂

And dude, the ending. I’m not gonna spoil it for you if you haven’t 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 the   yet, but let’s just say it leaves a weird taste. Bittersweet or just plain bitter? I can't tell. I guess it depends on how optimistic you are. But that final showdown... it had me on the edge, even if the pacing was weirdly off. Do they do that on purpose? Or just me overthinking again?

btw, sys.stdout.write(I have no clue why I thought of this lol)

Would I recommend it? Hell yeah, if only to see what your brain does with the concept. It’s a ride, for sure. But, you know, one of those where you’re laughing and thinking “what the hell am I laughing at” in the same breath. Anyway, I’ll stop blabbing now, it’s late and my brain’s fried. Tell me what you think when you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it!
